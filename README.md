# QUANTITATIVE FINANCE — STOCHASTIC MODELING AND DECISION MAKING

This repository documents the theoretical, mathematical, and computational
development of the main models used in Quantitative Finance for decision
making under uncertainty. The project follows a rigorous quantitative
approach, typical of quant-style work: mathematical formulation of the
problem, model derivation, parameter estimation, simulation, and financial
interpretation of results.  

The content is built in alignment with the objectives, methodology, and
learning guide of the Quantitative Finance course, and is oriented toward
solving real-world corporate financial problems.


## GENERAL OBJECTIVE

To correctly apply project valuation models with stochastic variables,
decision trees, simulation, and risk-neutral valuation in order to solve
common corporate problems, including the valuation of financial options and
investment decision-making through the use of real options.


## PROJECT APPROACH

The repository follows a structured approach based on three core layers:

1. Mathematical modeling:
   - Formal representation of uncertainty through stochastic variables and
     processes.
   - Construction of probabilistic models for decision making.

2. Quantitative implementation:
   - Translation of analytical models into computational algorithms.
   - Numerical simulation and parameter estimation using data.

3. Financial analysis:
   - Economic interpretation of results.
   - Evaluation of the impact of risk and uncertainty on financial and
     corporate decisions.


## MAIN CONTENT

1. Modeling for decision making under uncertainty
   - Stochastic variables and probability distributions.
   - Likelihood functions and parameter estimation.
   - Decision trees and their relationship with simulation.
   - Introduction to real options from a quantitative perspective.

2. Simulation and stochastic analysis
   - Monte Carlo simulation applied to financial problems.
   - Relationship between simulation, risk, and joint probability
     distributions.
   - Scenario analysis and sensitivity evaluation.

3. Stochastic models for asset prices
   - Simple and logarithmic returns.
   - Random walk and diffusion processes.
   - Construction of asset price models.

4. Risk-neutral valuation and financial derivatives
   - Derivation of the Black–Scholes model.
   - Risk-neutral valuation framework.
   - Valuation of vanilla call and put options.
   - Sensitivity analysis (financial Greeks).

5. Real options and investment decisions
   - Extension of financial option models to real investment projects.
   - Exchange models and compound options.
   - Strategic decision making under uncertainty.
   - Practical applications of customized real options.


## REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

The repository is organized in a modular way to reflect the natural flow of
quantitative analysis:

- Notebooks for theoretical development and computational implementation.
- Scripts for simulation, estimation, and valuation.
- Financial datasets used in the models.
- Documentation containing theoretical notes and mathematical explanations.


## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

- Python as the main language for quantitative development.
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis, simulation, and visualization.
- Scientific libraries for numerical computation and financial modeling.


## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

By the end of this project, the repository aims to:

- Develop a deep understanding of the relationship between uncertainty,
  mathematical modeling, and decision making.
- Formulate and solve financial models with stochastic variables.
- Apply solid quantitative criteria to asset valuation and investment
  project analysis.
- Use real options as an advanced decision-making tool.


## FINAL NOTE

This repository is not intended to present closed-form recipes, but to
document the complete quantitative process: problem formulation, model
construction, incorporation of uncertainty, and financial interpretation.

In quantitative finance, models do not replace judgment — they discipline it.
